    <p>Welcome to the Mike-in-Maine.github.io project repository! This project revolves around the analysis of book prices over time from various online marketplaces, including Amazon 📦, eBay 🛒, and more. The objective is to extract valuable insights from this data and potentially create a predictive model for future book prices.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The primary focus of this project is to understand and analyze the trends in book prices on online platforms. While predicting prices, especially in the ever-changing online marketplace, can be challenging, we aim to address key questions and explore possibilities.</p>

    <h2>Key Questions ❓</h2>

    <h3>1. Is a Predictive Model Possible?</h3>
    <p>The first question that arises is whether it's feasible to create a predictive model for book prices. Given the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of online markets, this is a challenging task. Nonetheless, we'll explore the feasibility and potential approaches.</p>

    <h3>2. Price Range Prediction</h3>
    <p>While an accurate price prediction might be difficult, we'll consider the possibility of predicting price ranges. A price range prediction could offer valuable insights, helping both sellers and buyers make informed decisions.</p>

    <h3>3. Holiday Season Impact 🎁</h3>
    <p>We'll also investigate whether book prices exhibit specific trends during the holiday season. The holiday period often influences consumer behavior and can impact prices. Analyzing these patterns may provide valuable information.</p>

    <p>Stay tuned for updates and insights as we delve deeper into this data analysis project.</p>

    <p>Your feedback and contributions are welcome!</p>
