# Mike-in-Maine.github.io 📚🌲

Welcome to the Mike-in-Maine.github.io project repository! This project revolves around the analysis of book prices over time from various online marketplaces, including Amazon 📦, eBay 🛒, and more. The objective is to extract valuable insights from this data and potentially create a predictive model for future book prices. 

## Project Overview
The primary focus of this project is to understand and analyze the trends in book prices on online platforms. While predicting prices, especially in the ever-changing online marketplace, can be challenging, we aim to address key questions and explore possibilities.

## Key Questions ❓

### 1. Is a Predictive Model Possible?
The first question that arises is whether it's feasible to create a predictive model for book prices. Given the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of online markets, this is a challenging task. Nonetheless, we'll explore the feasibility and potential approaches.

### 2. Price Range Prediction
While an accurate price prediction might be difficult, we'll consider the possibility of predicting price ranges. A price range prediction could offer valuable insights, helping both sellers and buyers make informed decisions.

### 3. Holiday Season Impact 🎁
We'll also investigate whether book prices exhibit specific trends during the holiday season. The holiday period often influences consumer behavior and can impact prices. Analyzing these patterns may provide valuable information.

Stay tuned for updates and insights as we delve deeper into this data analysis project.

Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
